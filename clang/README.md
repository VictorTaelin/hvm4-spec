# HVM4 Runtime Implementation in C

This file implements the HVM4, an Interaction Calculus runtime, ported from
Haskell. It includes parsing, stringification, and a stack-based weak normal
form (WNF) evaluator with all interaction rules.

## Term Pointer Layout (64-bit)

| SUB  (1 bit)   ::= marks heap slot as containing a substitution
| TAG  (7 bits)  ::= constructor variant (APP, LAM, SUP, etc.)
| EXT  (24 bits) ::= dup label, ctr name, or ref name
| VAL  (32 bits) ::= heap address or unboxed value

## Tag Encoding

- CO0/CO1: Two tags for Cop (copy) nodes, representing sides 0 and 1
- C00...C16: Constructor tags encode arity directly (C00+n for n fields)
- Names (variable, constructor, reference) use 6-char base64 strings encoded
  as 24-bit integers fitting in the EXT field

## Memory Model (No Separate Maps)

Unlike the Haskell version which uses IntMaps for 'dups' and 'subs', this
implementation stores everything directly on the heap:

- DUP nodes: Stored inline on heap. CO0/CO1 point to a dup node holding the
  duplicated expression (label stored in CO0/CO1's EXT field).

- Substitutions: Stored where the lambda's body, or duplicator expression,
  was. When app_lam fires, the argument replaces the lambda body slot. The
  SUB bit distinguishes actual terms from substitutions, allowing VAR, CO0
  and CO1 to detect whether their target is a binding node or a subst.

## Book vs Runtime Term Representation

Book terms (parsed definitions) use de Bruijn indices and are immutable:
  - VAR: ext = 0         ; val = bru_index
  - CO_: ext = dup_label ; val = bru_index
  - LAM: ext = bru_depth ; val = body_location
  - DUP: ext = dup_label ; val = expr_location

Runtime terms (after ALO allocation) use heap locations:
  - VAR : ext = 0         ; val = binding_lam_body_location
  - CO_ : ext = dup_label ; val = binding_dup_expr_location
  - LAM : ext = 0         ; val = expr_location
  - DUP : ext = 0         ; val = expr_location

## ALO (Allocation) Nodes

ALO terms reference immutable book entries and lazily convert them to
runtime terms. Each ALO stores a pair (bind_list, book_term_loc) packed
into a single 64-bit heap word:
  - Low 32 bits: book term location
  - High 32 bits: bind list head (linked list of binder locations)

The bind list maps de Bruijn levels to runtime heap locations of binding
LAM/DUP nodes. When an ALO interaction occurs, one layer of the book term
is extracted and converted to a runtime term.

## Stack-Based WNF Evaluator

To avoid stack overflow, WNF uses an explicit stack with two phases:

REDUCE phase: Push eliminators onto stack and descend into their targets
  - APP: push frame, enter function
  - MAT: push frame, enter scrutinee (after MAT reaches head position)
  - CO0/CO1: push frame, enter dup'd expression

APPLY phase: Pop frames and dispatch interactions based on WHNF result

DUP and ALO don't push stack frames since they immediately trigger their
respective interactions without requiring sub-WNF results first.

## Internal-Only Constructs

These nodes are internal and not parseable:
- ALO: lazy alloc

Stuck terms use special CTR names:
- #VAR{#name{}}: stuck variable (name encoded as 0-arity CTR)
- #APP{f,x}: stuck application

## Collapse Function

Extracts superpositions (SUP) to the top level. For each term type:
1. Collapse subterms recursively
2. Build a template: nested lambdas that reconstruct the term
3. Call inject(template, collapsed_subterms)
This will move the term to inside SUP layers, 'collapsing' it.

Key: VARs in templates must point to their binding lambda's body location.
For LAM, the inner lambda MUST reuse lam_loc so existing VARs stay bound.
