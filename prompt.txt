currently functions (like @foo = ...) and refs (@foo) use 4-letter nicks, where
each letter is 6 bits. this is done so it can fit on the ext field of their Term
pointers, which is 24 bit. this is annoying for users. our goal now is to add a
new module, table/, which implements a global id→name table, mapping parsed
names to unique ids. this table is populated when we parse a function definition
or reference, and it is accessed when we stringify them.

so, for example, when an user defines:

@my_cool_fn = λx. x

we would register a map:

0 → "my_cool_fn"

then, if we print a REF with ext=0, we would print @my_cool_fn.

note this should affect only functions / refs, not anything else.
